# Databases

## What is a Relational Database?

Uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data *in relation* to another piece of data in the database. Often organized into tables.

## What is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)?

A program that allows you to create, update, and administer a relational database. Most relational database management systems use the SQL language to access the database.

## What is SQL?

SQL (**S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage) is a programming language used to communicate with data stored in a relational database management system.

Many RDBMSs use SQL (and variations of SQL) to access the data in tables

## Popular Relational Database Management Systems

**[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)**

MySQL is the most popular open source SQL database. typically used for web application development

-  easy to use, inexpensive, reliable (has been around since 1995), and has a large community of developer

-  disadvantages:  poor performance when scaling, does not include some advanced features 

**[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)**

open source SQL database that is not controlled by any corporation. It is typically used for web application development.

- shares many of the same advantages of MySQL. It is easy to use, inexpensive, reliable and has a large community of developers. It also provides some additional features such as foreign key support without requiring complex configuration.
- disadvantage:it can be slower in performance than other databases such as MySQL. It is also slightly less popular than MySQL.

**[Oracle DB](https://www.oracle.com/database/)**

Oracle Corporation owns Oracle Database, and the code is not open sourced.

for large applications, particularly in the banking industry.

disadvantage:  not free to use like its open source competitors and can be quite expensive.

**[SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2017)**

Microsoft

Large enterprise applications mostly use SQL Server.

Microsoft offers a free entry-level version called *Express* but can become very expensive as you scale your application.

**[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)**

popular open source SQL database. It can store an entire database in a single file. One of the most significant advantages this provides is that all of the data can be stored locally without having to connect your database to a server.

SQLite is a popular choice for databases in cellphones, PDAs, MP3 players, set-top boxes, and other electronic gadgets.
